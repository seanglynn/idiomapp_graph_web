# Archived Code

This directory contains archived code that is no longer actively used in the main project but is preserved for reference.

## Contents

### FastAPI Application

The `idiomapp/api/` directory contains a previous implementation of a FastAPI backend for graph data that is no longer in active use. The project now primarily uses the Streamlit frontend with direct Ollama integration.

## Why Archived?

This code has been moved to the archive to simplify the active codebase and focus development on the Streamlit application. The FastAPI implementation may be useful for reference or if API functionality needs to be reintroduced in the future.

## Using Archived Code

If you need to reactivate any code from this archive:

1. Review the code to ensure it's compatible with the current project structure
2. Move the relevant files back to the main project directory
3. Update imports and dependencies as needed
4. Add appropriate Makefile commands for running the components
