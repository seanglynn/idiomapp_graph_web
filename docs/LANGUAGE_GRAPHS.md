## Semantic Graphs: Revealing Translation Meaning

- **Nodes** = words in different languages
- **Edges** = translation relationships and meaning connections

When you translate text in Idiomapp, it creates a semantic network that shows:

- Direct translations between languages (e.g., "dog" ‚Üí "perro")
- Related words within each language
- Part-of-speech connections

**Key Features:**
- Words are color-coded by language (üá¨üáß blue, üá™üá∏ pink, üè¥Û†Å•Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø purple)
- Edge thickness shows translation strength
- Node size indicates word importance

This visualization helps you see how concepts map across languages, revealing both similarities and differences in expression.

## Co-occurrence Networks: Words That Travel Together

- **Nodes** = individual words
- **Edges** = words that appear near each other in text

The co-occurrence view shows:

- Which words frequently appear together
- Key terms in a text by their connections
- Natural word groupings based on usage

**Analysis Options:**
- Adjust window size (how close words must be)
- Filter by minimum frequency
- Focus on specific parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives)

Larger nodes appear more frequently, and thicker edges indicate words that co-occur more often.

- Discover related word concepts across languages
- Identify translation patterns and linguistic structures

### Co-occurrence Network Benefits
- See which words naturally group together in each language
- Understand typical word pairings and phrases
- Recognize important context words

## Example: Translating a Simple Phrase

When translating "I enjoy drinking coffee every morning":

1. **Semantic Graph**
   - "coffee" ‚Üí "caf√©" (Spanish) ‚Üí "caf√®" (Catalan)
   - "morning" ‚Üí "ma√±ana" ‚Üí "mat√≠"
   - Connections between "enjoy" and related terms

2. **Co-occurrence Network**
   - English: "coffee" strongly linked with "morning"
   - Spanish: "caf√©" connected to "cada" (every) and "ma√±ana"

By switching between views, you can analyze both the meaning relationships and usage patterns across languages!

## Tips for Using Language Graphs

- **Compare languages**: Select different target languages to see structural differences
- **Analyze completeness**: A well-connected graph suggests good translation quality
- **Look for clusters**: Word groupings often reveal important themes
- **Check isolated words**: These might be specialized terms or missing translations

The graphs make language relationships visible, turning abstract translations into interactive knowledge maps!
